# Basic Styling

In this tutorial, we're gonna see how we can work a little on the style and coloring of our HTML document.

> This tutorial is actually a CSS subject but we're gonna use it very basic and simple. So you can think of this tutorial as an introduction to CSS.

In HTML, in addition to defining a tag, you can give that tag certain information called attributes or properties, and we're gonna work with the `style` attribute here.

define an opening paragraph tag and type "style" after that:

``` HTML
<body>
    <p style="color: gold; background-color: darkgray;">This text will be styled!</p>
</body>
```

then you set the style equal to "color" and you put a colon and then type the **color name** or **color's hex code** or **RBG**.

> RBG format will be like: `rbg(RED, GREEN, BLUE)`


* if you want to pass more than one value to "style" you need to specify them with semicolon **`;`**.

You can also apply the styling to the body tag to have the whole page colored:
