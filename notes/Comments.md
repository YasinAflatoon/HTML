# Comments

In HTML, we use comments to make our code more readable, especially in cases in which we want to share our code with another developer and comments will be always ignored by the browser.

In HTML, we can create a comment using a special tag:

``` HTML
<body>
    <!-- <p>This is a commented text</p>-->
    <p>Hey Everybody!</p>
</body>
```

It's kinda easy to use and note that we need to put two hyphens at the end of our comment, if not, the rest of our code will be commented too!
