# Get Started

In HTML we work with a series of tags that define the layout and the base skeleton of our website and these tags are stored in a file with `.html` format so your web browser can display them as web pages.

Okay! Let's start!

## Choosing a Text Editor

The first step in writing HTML is choosing a text editor that allows you to edit text files and save them in different formats and it doesn't have to be a word processing app (like `Microsoft Word` or `Google Docs`)

> For writing HTML, all you need is a text editor that supports `.txt` files!

### Simple Text Editors

It is recommended to use the simplest text editor you have on your computer like `Notepad` on Windows or `Text-Edit` on Mac because you are actually working with pure text without using auto-correction/completion.

Simple text editors might look boring but they will help you to focus on learning, not working with plugins or extensions.

### Alternative Option

If you find simple editors boring, you can use some programs, specially designed to write HTML or other types of texts. There are some popular ones out there like [`VsCode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [`Atom`](https://atom.io/), and [`Sublime`](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I use VsCode, you can choose whatever you like and feel comfortable with.  

> The best text editor is the one that maximizes your productivity.

and that's that. you are all set to write your first HTML code!
